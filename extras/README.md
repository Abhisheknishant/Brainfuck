This is a collection of other BF interpreters and compilers.

The files bf2c_v1.b and bf2c_v2.b are simple BF to C converters the second does RLE (strangely). The other bf2c* are also converters from BF to C written in their respective languages.

The C programs are all interpreters, mostly components that were merged into one of my major interpreters or attempts on the theme of "small but tidy".

The perl (*.pl) ones are very simple converters for various BF equivalent languages; all based on the original bf.pl.

The files bf2bash.sh, bf2lua.lua and also bf.pl are interpreters that convert to the host language then use an "eval" command.
