This is the Neutron brainfuck interpreter.
It's rather small and dense, but still readable.

It's a wrapping 8 bit interpreter, the type of the 'val' field controls
this and you can change it simply by changing that type.

The size of the program, tape and number of nested loops are limited only
by available memory.  In practice this means about 250,000,000 cells if
compiled as a 32bit application. Compiling as 64bit will use twice the
RAM per cell so you need at least 6Gb of FREE ram before this is likely
to allow more cells.

The program does not optimise the BF in any way. (It's a bit slow!)

Newline processing is inherited from the C stdio library.
Input leaves the current cell unchanged on EOF.
The "stdout" stream is unbuffered.

If the program specified on the command line there are no special controls.
If the program is read from "stdin" a "!" character marks the end of the
program and the start of the data.
