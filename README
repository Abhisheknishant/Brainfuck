Reasonable interpreters
-----------------------

proper-bf1.c
    Eight bit wrapping cells.
    Message: Hello World! 255.

proper-bf2.c
    Sixteen bit wrapping cells.
    Message: Hello world! 65535.

proper-bf3.c
    Cells are more than 16 bits signed.
    Message: Hello, world!.

proper-bf4.c
    Seven bit wrapping cells
    Message: Hello World! 127.

Sometimes reasonable interpreters
---------------------------------

weirds-bf1.c
    Eight bit wrapping cells with double ended tape.
    Message: Hello World! 255.

weirds-bf2.c
    Eight bit, saturating cells, inc to 255 and dec to 0.
    Message: Hello, world! Ltd.

weirds-bf3.c
    Eight bit, cell outside of 0..255 aborts interpreter.
    Message: Hello

weirds-bf4.c
    Eight bit, cell outside of -128..255 aborts interpreter.
    Message: Hello

repeat-bf1.c
    The [ command does not skip any loop.
    This interpreter is turing complete, but not brainfuck.
    See: https://esolangs.org/wiki/Newbiefuck
    Message: Hello... RUN! ZOMBIES!!

Interpreters with broken looping
--------------------------------

broken-bf1.c
    The [ command does not correctly skip of nested loops.
    Message: Hello... RUN! ZOMBIES!!

broken-bf2.c
    Loop nesting does not work at all, no skip over loops either.
    Message: Hello... RUN! ZOMBIES!!

broken-bf3.c
    Loop nesting does not work at all, however, loops can be skipped.
    Message: Hello... RUN! ZOMBIES!!

broken-bf4.c
    Loop nesting does not work at all, however, loops can be skipped.
    Message: Hello... RUN! ZOMBIES!!

broken-bf5.c
    Loops cannot be skipped over.
    Message: Hello... RUN! ZOMBIES!!

broken-bf6.c
    Loops cannot be skipped over and nesting is faulty.
    Message: Hello... RUN! ZOMBIES!!

broken-bf7.c
    Loops cannot be skipped over and nesting joins to last.
    Message: Hello... RUN! ZOMBIES!!

broken-bf8.c
    Skipping over nested loops is faulty.
    Message: Hello... RUN! ZOMBIES!!

broken-bf9.c
    Loops cannot be skipped over and more weirdness with nesting.
    Message: Hello... RUN! ZOMBIES!!

broken-bfA.c
    Nested loops cannot be skipped, other loops are weird.
    Message: ?

broken-bfD.c
    The ']' command is incorrectly run when the '[' command skips.
    Message: Hello (then lots of spaces)

broken-bfE.c
    Loops do not skip nor do unbalanced loops work correctly.
    Message: Hello... RUN! ZOMBIES!!

broken-bfG.c
    Incorrect skipping over nested loops.
    Message: Hello... RUN! ZOMBIES!!

broken-bfF.c
    Simplistic single loop and incorrect loop condition.
    Message: >V]]`(((.LOH..TIG<C?M

broken-bfH.c
    If skipping over loops the stack is used when it shouldn't be.
    Message: Hello Evil Vnqkc! WTF!

broken-bfK.c
    Looping is just broken.
    Message: >Y``c....BE>..J?=295C

Interpreters with broken cells
------------------------------

broken-bfB.c
    Seven bit cell with saturation to zero.
    Actually okay, but really unlikely to be intentional.
    Message: Hello World! Ltd WTF!.

broken-bfC.c
    Loop condition does not take account of negative cell contents.
    Message: Hello  # WTF!.

broken-bfI.c
    Crazy cell overflow breakage.
    Message: Hello Zombie World! 31.

broken-bfJ.c
    Overflow on inc wraps to -127, dec of 0 stays as zero.
    Message: Hello World! Ltd WTF!.

broken-bfN.c
    The '-' command does nothing when signed byte cell is negative.
    Message: Hello

Special breakage
----------------

broken-bfL.c
    Mismatched (and incorrect) conditions on loops.
    Message: Hello World.. WTF!.

broken-bfM.c
    The '<' command does not allow a return to cell zero.
    Message: Hello Zombie! 255.
